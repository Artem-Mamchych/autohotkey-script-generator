Follow these steps to get it working:

1 Download Console and put it somewhere (ie. C:\Program Files\Console2\)
2 Make sure it’s in your %path% system environment (Right-click My Computer, Properties, Advanced system settings, Advanced, Environment Variables)
3 Run it, go to Edit -> Settings. Change the settings to suit your taste
	Change your shell to PowerShell at C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe for Windows 7 and change your startup dir
	Change the window size columns to take up most of your screen
	Windows fonts suck, try Andale Mono or Monaco
	Make sure initial position is at 0, 0 and always on top
	Under Appearance -> More…, make sure it has no menu, no toolbar, no caption, not resizable, no border, no taskbar, no tray icon for minimal footprint
	Set your transparency
4 Download AutoHotkey and install it
5 Call top_scripts.addQuakeStyleShell() in create-ahk-script.py. After that QuakeTerminal.ahk will be included and shell open/close hotkwy will be Ctrl-`
6 Run the script and press your hotkey
7 Boom, you got a terminal at your fingertip
